# Global Lung Cancer Analysis

### Domain:
Healthcare Analytics / Medical Data Analysis
- Focused on lung cancer research, patient outcomes, and risk factors.
- Aimed at analyzing smoking, pollution exposure, survival rates, and their correlation with lung cancer progression.
________________________________________
### Function:
Data Analysis, Business Intelligence (BI), and Data Visualization
- Conducted data extraction, transformation, and visualization for deriving meaningful insights.
- Applied statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns in lung cancer patient data.

### Project Overview:
This project analyzes a lung cancer dataset to identify risk factors, smoking behavior, mortality rates, and survival outcomes. Using MySQL, Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint, the project provides interactive dashboards and visual reports to help understand how different variables affect lung cancer patients across demographics and countries.

### Problem Statement:
1.	How do smoking behaviors (active/passive) impact lung cancer diagnosis?
2.	What is the relationship between air pollution exposure and lung cancer mortality?
3.	How do treatment types influence survival rates across cancer stages?
4.	What are the key demographic factors (age, gender, country) that influence lung cancer prevalence?

### Data Cleaning Process:
1.	Data Import & Exploration: Loaded the dataset from Excel and MySQL into Power BI.
2.	Handling Missing Values:
- Replaced nulls with mean/median for continuous variables (e.g., Age, Years of Smoking).
- Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
3.	Standardized Data Types:
- Converted fields like Age, Gender, Smoker to appropriate formats (numeric/text).
4.	Derived New Features:
- Created "Lung Cancer Risk Score" by combining Years of Smoking, Air Pollution, etc.
- Calculated Mortality Rate, Survival Rate, and Smoking Impact Score using DAX in Power BI.
5.	Data Validation: Ensured consistency between MySQL queries and Power BI outputs.

### Key Insights:
1. Smoking & Lung Cancer:
- 7.07% of smokers in the dataset have lung cancer, with males having a higher smoking impact score.
2.	Age Factor:
- Most lung cancer patients fall within the 41-80 age group, indicating a higher risk in older adults.
3.	Gender Insights:
- 59.5% of lung cancer cases are female, while males show a higher smoking impact.
4.	Country Trends:
- China and the USA report the highest lung cancer deaths, with developed countries having a 76.03% prevalence rate.
5.	Air Pollution & Mortality:
- High exposure to air pollution correlates with an increased mortality rate across all stages.
6.	Treatment Effectiveness:
- Surgery, Chemotherapy, and Radiotherapy improve survival rates, while patients with no treatment have the highest mortality.

### Recommendations:
1.	Early Detection Programs: Increase screening in high-risk populations to improve early-stage detection.
2.	Targeted Intervention: Implement anti-smoking campaigns targeting male smokers in high-prevalence areas.
3.	Environmental Policies: Enhance air pollution control policies in countries with high mortality.
4.	Healthcare Access: Improve treatment accessibility in developing regions to reduce mortality rates.
5.	Data-Driven Decisions: Use predictive analytics to identify and monitor high-risk patients.

### What We Learned:
1.	Data-Driven Insights: How to extract actionable insights from complex healthcare datasets.
2.	Correlation Analysis: Established relationships between smoking, pollution, and lung cancer outcomes.
3.	BI Tools Mastery: Enhanced Power BI skills for data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling.
4.	Decision Support: Built interactive dashboards to assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.
